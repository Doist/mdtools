Command mdmovearound helps when reorganizing set of cross-referencing
markdown (.md) files. It should be run once before moving/renaming files,
and then run again to update broken cross-links.

It works by first recursively traversing directory making list of all
non-hidden files along with hashes of their contents. Once such list is
built and saved, on next call it loads list from previous run, builds list
once again for current directory state, then checks each markdown file (.md)
from this new list, trying to reconstruct broken links by finding file
renames via old and new hash lists. Upon successful completion it updates
saved list with current state.

Because it works by figuring out renames looking at file content hashes, it
only works for files that were NOT modified between calls to this program.

Since it may potentially update multiple files, the whole operation is not
atomic, so it is advisable to only run it over files versioned by VCS, so
that in case of any errors original files can be easily restored.

Currently only inline links like [link](dst.md) are supported; links like
[link][id] are NOT supported. The reason for this is that links are updated
by substring replacements inside text, this may lead to some invalid
replacements, and handling only inline links reduces risk of invalid
replacements. Please check results before committing them.
